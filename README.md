# Aircraft Engine Analytics - SQL Data Exploration and Failure Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing aircraft engine performance, detecting anomalies, and identifying failure patterns. The dataset includes key parameters such as engine temperature, vibration levels, fuel consumption, engine RPM, and failure reports.

## Features:
- Data Exploration – View engine data, check table structure, and count records
- Statistical Analysis – Min, max, and average values of key parameters
- Missing Data Detection – Identify missing values in critical fields
- Anomaly Detection – Find abnormal temperature, vibration, and fuel usage patterns
- Failure Analysis – Investigate failure types, frequency, and conditions
- Flight Phase Insights – Analyze how engine behavior varies across different flight phases

## Use Cases:
🚀 Predictive Maintenance
📊 Engine Health Monitoring
⛽ Fuel Efficiency Optimization
⚠️ Failure Pattern Recognition
